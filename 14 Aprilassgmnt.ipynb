    "patterns and interactions between the most important features. For example, you might\n",
    "observe that the decision boundaries are non-linear, indicating that the model captures\n",
    "non-linear relationships between features.\n",

    "2. **Limitations**:\n",
    "   - Limited Interpretability: While decision boundaries provide insights into model behavior,\n",
    "Random Forests are considered a \"black-box\" model, making it challenging to understand the\n",
    "reasoning behind individual predictions.\n",
    "   - Data Dependency: The insights gained from the decision boundaries are specific to the\n",
    "    dataset used for training. Different datasets may result in different decision boundaries, \n",
    "    and generalizing beyond the dataset can be challenging.\n",
    "   - Overfitting: Random Forests can overfit noisy data, leading to complex decision boundaries \n",
    "that may not generalize well to new, unseen data.\n",
    "   - Feature Importance: Feature importance scores are based on the training data and might\n",
    "    not accurately reflect the true importance of features in predicting heart disease risk.\n",
