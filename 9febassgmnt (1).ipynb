    "Ans: \n",
    "Multiple inheritance is a feature in object-oriented programming languages that allows a class to inherit attributes\n",

    "The Flyable class represents attributes and behaviors related to flying.\n",
    "The Bird class is a child class of both Animal and Flyable classes, demonstrating multiple inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bird class inherits from both Animal and Flyable classes using the syntax class Bird(Animal, Flyable):.\n",
    "This allows the Bird class to have access to the attributes and methods defined in both parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we create an instance of the Bird class and call its methods,\n",

    "Q4. What are getter and setter in python? Create a class and create a getter and a setter method in this\n",
    "class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  \n",
    "     \n",
    "In Python, getters and setters are methods used to access and modify the values of class attributes or properties. \n",
    "They provide a way to encapsulate the access and modification of attributes,\n",
    "allowing for controlled access and data validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A getter method, also known as an accessor method, retrieves the value of an attribute, while a setter method, \n",
    "also known as a mutator method, sets or updates the value of an attribute. By using getter and setter methods,\n",
    "we can enforce certain rules or validations when accessing or modifying the attributes of a class.\n",

    "In this example, we have a Person class with attributes _name and _age.\n",
    "The class provides getter and setter methods for both attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The getter methods (get_name() and get_age()) simply return the values of the attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The setter methods (set_name() and set_age()) allow for modifying the attribute values.\n",
    "In the case of set_age(), we have added a validation check to ensure that the age provided is not negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "We create an instance of the Person class named person and use the getter \n",
    "methods to retrieve the initial values of the attributes.\n",
    "Then, we use the setter methods to update the attribute values, including a negative value for age to demonstrate\n",
    "the validation check. Finally, we use the getter methods again to verify the updated values of the attributes.\n",

    "Q.no.5:   What is method overriding in python? Write a python code to demonstrate method overriding.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    Method overriding is a concept in object-oriented programming where a subclass provides a different implementation \n",
    "of a method that is already defined in its parent class. It allows the subclass to redefine the behavior of the method\n",
    "according to its specific requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a method is overridden in the subclass, the version of the method defined in the subclass is called instead of\n",
    "the version defined in the parent class when that method is invoked on an instance of the subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    " An example that demonstrates method overriding in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",
    "        print(\"The animal makes a sound.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",
    "        print(\"The dog barks.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",
    "        print(\"The cat meows.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "animal = Animal()\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "cat = Cat()\n",
    "\n",
    "animal.sound() \n",
    "\n",
    "Output: The animal makes a sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "dog.sound() \n",
    "\n",
    "Output: The dog barks.\n",
    "cat.sound()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: The cat meows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have a base class Animal with a method called sound(). \n",
    "The Dog and Cat classes are subclasses of Animal \n",
    "and they both override the sound() method with their own implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we create instances of Animal, Dog, and Cat and call the sound() method on each of them, the appropriate version\n",
    "of the method defined in the respective class is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example output, animal.sound() calls the method defined in the Animal class, dog.sound() calls the method defined\n",
    "in the Dog class, and cat.sound() calls the method defined in the Cat class. \n",
    "This demonstrates how method overriding allows subclasses to provide their own implementation of a method defined in\n",
    "the parent class."
