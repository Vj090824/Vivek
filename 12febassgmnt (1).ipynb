    "Q1. What is an Exception in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and syntax errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "    \n",
    "      In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program,\n",
    "        disrupting the normal flow of code. \n",
    "        When an exception occurs, the program's normal execution is interrupted, \n",
    "        and the control is transferred to an \n",
    "        exception handler that can handle the error gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions are raised (or thrown) when certain conditions are encountered during the execution of a program, \n",
    "such as division by zero, accessing an invalid index in a list, or opening a file that doesn\" exist. \n",
    "Python provides a mechanism to catch and handle exceptions using try-except blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, syntax errors are errors that occur when the Python interpreter encounters invalid syntax in the code.\n",
    "These errors prevent the program from being executed at all \n",
    "because the code cannot be parsed or understood by the interpreter.\n",
    "Syntax errors are usually caused by mistakes such as misspelled keywords,\n",
    "missing colons, unmatched parentheses, or incorrect \n",
    "indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key differences between exceptions and syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Occurrence: Exceptions occur during the execution of a program, while syntax errors are detected\n",
    "before the program starts running,\n",
    "during the parsing phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact: Exceptions disrupt the normal flow of code execution and require special\n",
    "handling to prevent the program from terminating\n",
    "abruptly. Syntax errors prevent the program from running altogether, \n",
    "and the code needs to be corrected before execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling: Exceptions can be caught and handled using try-except blocks,\n",
    "allowing the program to respond to errors gracefully. \n",
    "Syntax errors cannot be caught or handled programmatically because they prevent the program from running.\n",
    "\n",
    "Causes: Exceptions occur due to specific conditions encountered during runtime, \n",
    "such as invalid input or unexpected behavior. \n",
    "Syntax errors occur when the code violates the rules and structure of the Python language, \n",
    "such as incorrect syntax or incorrect use of language constructs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, exceptions are runtime errors that occur during the execution of a program and can be caught and handled.\n",
    "Syntax errors, on the other hand, are errors that occur before the program starts running, due to incorrect code syntax, \n",
    "and prevent the program from being executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.no.2:  What happens when an exception is not handled? Explain with an example.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:   \n",
    "     When an exception is not handled, it results in an \"unhandled exception\" or \"exception propagation.\"\n",
    "This means that the normal flow of the program is disrupted, \n",
    "and the program terminates abruptly without completing its intended execution.\n",
    "The exact behavior may vary depending on the programming language and the runtime environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example to illustrate the concept:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def divide_numbers(a, b):\n",
    "    result = a / b\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    num1 = 10\n",
    "    num2 = 0\n",
    "    result = divide_numbers(num1, num2)\n",
    "    print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "\n",
    "main()\n",
    "In this example, the divide_numbers function attempts to divide num1 by num2. However,\n",
    "dividing by zero is an invalid operation and raises a \"ZeroDivisionError\" exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this exception is not handled, the program will terminate abruptly and an error message will be displayed,\n",
    "indicating an unhandled exception occurred:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"example.py\", line 9, in main\n",
    "    result = divide_numbers(num1, num2)\n",
    "  File \"example.py\", line 2, in divide_numbers\n",
    "    result = a / b \n",
    "    \n",
    "     ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the exception propagates through the call stack until it reaches the top-level of the program\n",
    "(main function in this case), where it remains unhandled. The program execution halts, and any subsequent code\n",
    "that was supposed to execute after the exception is not executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent the program from terminating abruptly, exceptions need to be handled using appropriate error-handling \n",
    "mechanisms such as try-except blocks. By handling exceptions, you can gracefully respond to exceptional conditions,\n",
    "log errors, provide alternative actions, or inform the user about the problem, allowing the program to continue its\n",
    "execution without crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "Q.no.3:  Which Python statements are used to catch and handle exceptions? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "AnS:   \n",
    "      In Python, the statements used to catch and handle exceptions are try, except, else, and finally. \n",

    "Q5. What are Custom Exceptions in python? Why do we need Custom Exceptions? Explain with an example.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  Custom exceptions in Python are user-defined exceptions that inherit from the built-in Exception class or any of its\n",
    "subclasses. They allow you to define and raise your own specific exceptions that suit the requirements of your application \n",
    "or problem domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need custom exceptions in Python for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Enhancing Readability: By creating custom exceptions, you can provide meaningful and descriptive names to the exceptions\n",
    "specific to your application. This improves the readability and maintainability of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity and Reusability: Custom exceptions allow you to encapsulate the \n",
    "details of an error or exceptional condition within a specific context.\n",
    "This makes your code more modular, reusable, and promotes separation of concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error Handling: Custom exceptions provide a way to handle exceptional cases that are unique to your application. \n",
    "You can catch and handle these exceptions separately, \n",
    "allowing you to take appropriate actions based on the specific type of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example to illustrate the use of custom exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class BankException(Exception):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Base custom exception for banking application.\"\"\"\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class InsufficientFundsException(BankException):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Exception raised when there are insufficient funds in an account.\"\"\"\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class InvalidTransactionException(BankException):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Exception raised when an invalid transaction is performed.\"\"\"\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Account:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, balance):\n",
    "        self.balance = balance\n",
    "\n",
    "    def withdraw(self, amount):\n",
    "        if amount > self.balance:\n",
    "            raise InsufficientFundsException(\"Insufficient funds in the account.\")\n",
    "        elif amount <= 0:\n",
    "            raise InvalidTransactionException(\"Invalid withdrawal amount.\")\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            self.balance -= amount\n",
    "            print(\"Withdrawal successful. New balance:\", self.balance)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    account = Account(1000)\n",
    "    account.withdraw(1500)\n",
    "\n",
    "except InsufficientFundsException as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Error:\", str(e))\n",
    "\n",
    "except InvalidTransactionException as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Error:\", str(e))\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "In this example, we define a custom exception hierarchy related to a banking application. The base exception class is\n",
    "BankException, and we define two specific exceptions, InsufficientFundsException and InvalidTransactionException,\n",
    "which inherit from BankException.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Account class has a withdraw method that performs a withdrawal from an account. \n",
    "If the withdrawal amount exceeds the account\n",
    "balance, an InsufficientFundsException is raised. If the withdrawal amount is zero or negative,\n",
    "an InvalidTransactionException  is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example usage, we create an Account instance with a balance of 1000 and attempt to withdraw 1500,\n",
    "which triggers the InsufficientFundsException. The exception is caught by the corresponding except block,\n",
    "and the error message is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using custom exceptions, you can provide more specific and meaningful error messages, \n",
    "handle exceptional cases differently, \n",
    "and create a more robust and maintainable codebase.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.no.6:  Create a custom exception class. use this class to handle an exception.\n",

    "Ans:  An example of creating a custom exception class and using it to handle an exception:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class CustomException(Exception):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, message):\n",
    "        self.message = message\n",
    "        super().__init__(self.message)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def divide_numbers(a, b):\n",
    "    if b == 0:\n",
    "        raise CustomException(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n",
    "    return a / b\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = divide_numbers(10, 0)\n",
    "    print(f\"The result is: {result}\")\n",
    "except CustomException as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Error occurred: {e.message}\")\n",
    "In this example, we define a custom exception class called CustomException by inheriting from the built-in Exception class.\n",
    "The CustomException class has an __init__ method that takes a message parameter and sets it as an instance variable. \n",
    "It also calls the __init__ method of the parent class (Exception) with the message parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we define a function divide_numbers that attempts to perform a division operation.\n",
    "If the divisor (b) is zero, we raise a CustomException with an appropriate error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the try block, we call the divide_numbers function with 10 and 0 as arguments. \n",
    "Since this would result in division by zero, the CustomException is raised. \n",
    "The except block catches the CustomException and prints the error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of running this code would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Error occurred: Cannot divide by zero\n",
    "By creating a custom exception class, you can define your own exceptions with specific behaviors and error messages, \n",
    "allowing you to handle exceptional cases in a more controlled manner.\n",
