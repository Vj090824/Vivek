    "Ans:  \n",
    "      Matplotlib is a popular data visualization library for Python.\n",
    "        It provides a wide range of tools and functions to create static,\n",
    "        animated, and interactive plots, graphs, and charts. Matplotlib is widely used in various\n",
    "        fields such as data analysis, scientific \n",
    "        research, engineering, finance, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are five plots that can be created using the Pyplot module of Matplotlib:\n",
    "\n",
    "Line Plot: This is a basic plot that displays data points connected by straight line segments. \n",
    "It is commonly used to show the trend or \n",
    "relationship between two variables over a continuous range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scatter Plot: Scatter plots are used to visualize the relationship between two variables by \n",
    "representing data points as individual dots.\n",
    "Each dot represents the values of the two variables on the x and y-axis, making it useful for\n",
    "identifying patterns or correlations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bar Plot: A bar plot represents data using rectangular bars with heights or lengths proportional\n",
    "to the values they represent. \n",
    "It is often used to compare and visualize categorical or discrete data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Histogram: Histograms provide a visual representation of the distribution of a dataset. \n",
    "It divides the data into bins and displays \n",
    "the frequency or count of values falling within each bin.\n",
    "Histograms are useful for understanding the shape, central tendency,\n",
    "and spread of numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pie Chart: Pie charts are circular plots divided into slices, \n",
    "where each slice represents a proportion or percentage of a whole. \n",
    "They are commonly used to show the composition or distribution of categorical data,\n",
    "such as market share, population breakdowns, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few examples of the types of plots that can be created using the Pyplot module of Matplotlib. \n",
    "It offers many more plot types and customization options to cater to various visualization needs.\n",

    "    A scatter plot is a type of plot used to visualize the relationship between two variables.\n",

    "       The subplot() function in Matplotlib is used to create multiple subplots within a single figure. \n",

    "Showing trends: Bar plots can be used to visualize trends over time or across different conditions.\n",
    "By plotting the values on the y-axis\n",
    "and categories on the x-axis, you can observe how the values change or differ for each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Presenting frequencies or counts: Bar plots are useful for displaying the frequency or \n",
    "count of occurrences of different categories. \n",
    "The height of each bar represents the frequency or count of the corresponding category.\n",

    "The key elements of a box plot are as follows:\n",
