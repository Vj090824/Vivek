    "Q4. What is ‘DataFrame’ in pandas and how is it different from pandas.series? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  \n",
    "     In pandas, a DataFrame is a two-dimensional data structure that is similar to a table or spreadsheet.\n",
    "        It consists of rows and columns, where each column can have a different data type.\n",
    "        A DataFrame can be thought of as a collection of Pandas Series objects, where each column represents a Series.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a Pandas Series is a one-dimensional data structure that represents a single column of data in a DataFrame.\n",
    "It can be seen as a labeled array, where each element has an associated index. A Series can hold data of any type (integer, float, string, etc.), and all the elements in a Series must have the same data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example to illustrate the difference between a DataFrame and a Series:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example DataFrame\n",
    "data = {\n",

    "    'Age': [25, 30, 27],\n",
    "    'Gender': ['Female', 'Male', 'Female']\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n",

    "# Example Series\n",
    "ages = pd.Series([25, 30, 27])\n",

    "\n",

    "0  Alice   25  Female\n",
    "1    Bob   30    Male\n",
    "2  Claire  27  Female\n",

    "1    30\n",
    "2    27\n",
    "\n",
    "dtype: int64\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, df represents a DataFrame that contains three columns: 'Name', 'Age', and 'Gender'. \n",
    "Each column in the DataFrame is a Pandas Series, where 'Name' and 'Gender' are Series of strings, and 'Age' is a Series of integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, ages represents a single Series that holds the ages of three individuals. \n",
    "The Series has its own index (0, 1, 2), and all the elements are of the same data type (integers).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a DataFrame is a two-dimensional structure that can hold multiple Series, whereas a Series is a one-dimensional \n",

    "Q5. What are some common functions you can use to manipulate data in a Pandas DataFrame? Can\n",
    "you give an example of when you might use one of these functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:   \n",
    "     Pandas provides a wide range of functions to manipulate and transform data in a DataFrame. Some common functions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "head() and tail(): These functions allow you to view the first few rows (head()) or last few rows (tail()) of a DataFrame.\n",
    "They are useful for quickly inspecting the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "df.head()  # View the first 5 rows of the DataFrame\n",
    "df.tail(3)  # View the last 3 rows of the DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "info(): This function provides a concise summary of a DataFrame, including the column names, data types, and number of non-null values.\n",
    "It is useful for understanding the structure of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "df.info()  # Display summary information about the DataFrame\n",
    "describe(): This function generates descriptive statistics of the numerical columns in a DataFrame, such as count, mean, \n",
    "standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartiles. It provides insights into the distribution of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "df.describe()  # Generate summary statistics of numerical columns\n",
    "sort_values(): This function allows you to sort the DataFrame by one or more columns. It is useful for organizing the data in a desired order.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "df_sorted = df.sort_values('Age')  # Sort the DataFrame by the 'Age' column\n",
    "groupby(): This function enables grouping the data based on one or more columns. It is often used in combination with aggregation\n",
    "functions like sum(), mean(), count(), etc., to compute summary statistics for each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "grouped_df = df.groupby('Gender')  # Group the data by the 'Gender' column\n",
    "mean_age_by_gender = grouped_df['Age'].mean()  # Compute the mean age for each gender\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few examples of the many functions available in Pandas to manipulate and analyze data in a DataFrame. \n",

    "Q6. Which of the following is mutable in nature Series, DataFrame, Panel?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Among the options provided, both Series and DataFrame are mutable in nature, while Panel is not. \n",
    "    \n",
    "     Pandas, a mutable object can be modified or changed after its creation. Let's take a closer look at each option:\n",
    "\n",
    "Series: A Pandas Series is a one-dimensional array-like object that can hold data of any type.\n",
    "It is mutable, meaning you can modify its values or reassign new values to specific elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "s = pd.Series([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "s[1] = 10  # Modifying the value at index 1\n",
    "\n",
    "DataFrame: A Pandas DataFrame is a two-dimensional tabular data structure consisting of rows and columns.\n",
    "It is also mutable, allowing you to modify the values within the DataFrame, add or remove columns, or perform other operations to \n",
    "change its structure or content.\n",
    "\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Claire'], 'Age': [25, 30, 27]}\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n",
    "df['Age'] = [26, 31, 28]  # Modifying the 'Age' column values\n",
    "\n",
    "Panel: A Pandas Panel is a three-dimensional data structure, similar to a DataFrame but with an additional axis. \n",
    "Panels are not mutable in nature, which means you cannot directly modify the values or structure of a Panel once it is created. \n",
    "Panels have been deprecated in recent versions of Pandas in favor of multi-indexed DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "data = {'Item1': pd.DataFrame([['A', 'B'], ['C', 'D']]),\n",
    "        'Item2': pd.DataFrame([['E', 'F'], ['G', 'H']])}\n",
    "panel = pd.Panel(data)\n",
    "# panel is not mutable and can't be modified\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, both Series and DataFrame are mutable in nature, allowing modifications to their values or structure.\n",
    "Panel, on the other hand, is not mutable and has been deprecated in favor of other data structures like multi-indexed DataFrames.\n",

    "Q7. Create a DataFrame using multiple Series. Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:    \n",
    "     A DataFrame is a two-dimensional data structure that consists of rows and columns, similar to a table or spreadsheet. \n",
    "Each column in a DataFrame is represented by a Series.\n",
    "\n",
    " An example of creating a DataFrame using multiple Series:\n",

    "\n",
    "# Define the data for each series\n",
    "names = pd.Series(['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David'])\n",
    "ages = pd.Series([25, 30, 35, 40])\n",
    "cities = pd.Series(['New York', 'London', 'Paris', 'Tokyo'])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a dictionary to store the series\n",
    "data = {\n",
    "    'Name': names,\n",
    "    'Age': ages,\n",
    "    'City': cities\n",
    "}\n",

    "0    Alice   25  New York\n",
    "1      Bob   30    London\n",
    "2  Charlie   35     Paris\n",
    "3    David   40     Tokyo\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have three Series: names, ages, and cities. Each Series represents a column in the DataFrame.\n",
    "We create a dictionary data where the keys are the column names ('Name', 'Age', 'City') and the values are the corresponding Series.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then pass this dictionary to the pd.DataFrame() function to create the DataFrame df. Finally, we print the DataFrame to see the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting DataFrame has three columns: 'Name', 'Age', and 'City'. Each row represents a separate entry,\n",
    "with the corresponding values from the Series. This way, we  can combine multiple Series to create a structured DataFrame with labeled columns\n",
