    "    \n",
    "    Eigen decomposition, also known as eigenvalue decomposition or spectral decomposition,\n",

    "1. Diagonalization: Eigen decomposition transforms the original matrix A into a diagonal matrix D.\n",
    "In this diagonal form, the eigenvalues appear on the main diagonal, and the eigenvectors define \n",

    "Eigen-Decomposition approach? Provide a brief proof to support your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    A square matrix is diagonalizable using the Eigen-Decomposition approach if\n",
    "    and only if it meets the following conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Matrix Size**: The matrix must be square, meaning it has an equal number of\n",
    "rows and columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Linearly Independent Eigenvalues**: The matrix must have a set of linearly\n",
    "independent eigenvectors corresponding to its eigenvalues. In other words, for each\n",
    "distinct eigenvalue λ, there must be a linearly independent set of eigenvectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's provide a brief proof for these conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Condition 1: Matrix Size**\n",
    "\n",
    "This condition is straightforward. The eigen-decomposition approach is applicable only \n",
    "to square matrices because it involves finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which are \n",
    "specific to square matrices. If the matrix is not square (i.e., it has a different number\n",
    "of rows and columns), it cannot have an eigen-decomposition.\n",

    "**Condition 2: Linearly Independent Eigenvalues**\n",
    "\n",

    "independent eigenvectors corresponding to its eigenvalues. These eigenvectors can be\n",
    "denoted as v₁, v₂, ..., vn, and their corresponding eigenvalues are λ₁, λ₂, ..., λn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's create a matrix V whose columns are these linearly independent eigenvectors:\n",

    "And a diagonal matrix Λ whose diagonal elements are the eigenvalues:\n",
    "\n",
    "Λ = diag(λ₁, λ₂, ..., λn)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can express matrix A in terms of these matrices as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "A = VΛV⁻¹\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's calculate A²:\n",
    "\n",
    "A² = (VΛV⁻¹)(VΛV⁻¹)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the properties of diagonal matrices and matrix multiplication,\n",
    "we can simplify this expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "A² = VΛ²V⁻¹\n",
    "\n",
    "In this form, it's easy to see that for any positive integer k, Ak can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ak = VΛkV⁻¹\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, consider the limit as k approaches infinity:\n",
    "\n",
    "lim(k→∞) Ak = lim(k→∞) VΛkV⁻¹\n",
    "\n",
    "Since λ₁, λ₂, ..., λn are the eigenvalues of A, it follows that λ₁ⁿ, λ₂ⁿ, ..., λnⁿ\n",
    "are the eigenvalues of Ak. Therefore, the above limit can be rewritten as:\n",
    "\n",
    "lim(k→∞) Ak = V diag(λ₁ⁿ, λ₂ⁿ, ..., λnⁿ) V⁻¹\n",
    "\n",
    "If all eigenvalues λ₁, λ₂, ..., λn are distinct and non-zero, then λ₁ⁿ, λ₂ⁿ, ..., λnⁿ\n",
    "will also be distinct and non-zero for any positive integer n. Consequently, the limit\n",
    "of Ak as k approaches infinity will exist and be non-zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if the matrix A has linearly independent eigenvectors for all of its\n",
    "eigenvalues, it can be diagonalized by the Eigen-Decomposition approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a square matrix is diagonalizable using the Eigen-Decomposition approach\n",

    "**1. Significance of the Spectral Theorem:**\n",
    "The spectral theorem is a result that provides a powerful and elegant way to understand \n",

    "This decomposition is also known as the Eigen-Decomposition or diagonalization of A.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Relationship to Diagonalizability:**\n",
    "The spectral theorem tells us that a matrix A is diagonalizable if and only if it is self-adjoint\n",

    "or A = PDP^*, where P is orthogonal (unitary) and D is diagonal, then A is diagonalizable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "Let's illustrate this with a simple example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following real symmetric matrix A:\n",

    "\n",
    "A = |  4  2 |\n",

    "Next, we find the corresponding eigenvectors. For λ1 = 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "A - 3I = | 1  2 |\n",
    "           | 2  2 |\n",

    "Q5. How do you find the eigenvalues of a matrix and what do they represent?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    \n",
    " Finding the eigenvalues of a matrix is a fundamental concept in linear algebra,\n",
    "and it plays a crucial role in various mathematical and scientific applications.\n",
    "Eigenvalues are associated with square matrices (matrices with the same number of rows and columns)\n",
    "and can be used to understand certain properties of the matrix and its corresponding linear \n",
    "transformations. Here's how you find the eigenvalues of a matrix and what they represent:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Definition:\n",
    "   Eigenvalues are scalar values that represent how a matrix transforms a vector. \n",
    "If A is a square matrix, and λ (lambda) is a scalar, and v is a nonzero vector, such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "   A * v = λ * v\n",
    "\n",
    "   Then, λ is an eigenvalue of A, and v is the corresponding eigenvector.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Finding Eigenvalues:\n",
    "   To find the eigenvalues of a matrix A, you need to solve the characteristic equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "   det(A - λI) = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "   Where:\n",
    "   - det(A - λI) is the determinant of the matrix A minus λ times the identity matrix I.\n",
    "   - λ (lambda) is the eigenvalue you're trying to find.\n",
    "\n",
    "   This equation will give you one or more values of λ, which are the eigenvalues of A.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Interpretation:\n",
    "   Eigenvalues represent how a linear transformation (represented by the matrix A)\n",
    "scales or stretches vectors in space. Each eigenvalue λ corresponds to a different way \n",
    "in which A scales vectors. Here are some key points regarding eigenvalues:\n",
    "\n",
    "   a. If λ > 0, it means that A stretches vectors.\n",
    "   b. If λ < 0, it means that A reflects vectors (reverses their direction).\n",
    "   c. If λ = 0, it means that A collapses vectors to the origin or reduces their dimensionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The magnitude of λ represents the factor by which A scales (or reflects) the\n",
    "    corresponding eigenvector. If |λ| > 1, the eigenvector is stretched, and if 0 < |λ| < 1, \n",
    "    the eigenvector is shrunk. If |λ| = 1, the eigenvector is only rotated, with no change in magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Real and Complex Eigenvalues:\n",
    "   Eigenvalues can be real or complex numbers. Real eigenvalues are associated\n",
    "with stretching or reflecting transformations in real space, while complex eigenvalues \n",
    "often indicate rotation or oscillatory behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Multiplicity:\n",
    "   Eigenvalues can have multiplicity, which means that the same eigenvalue may\n",
    "appear multiple times. The number of times an eigenvalue appears in the characteristic\n",
    "equation is called its algebraic multiplicity. Each eigenvalue may also have a\n",
    "corresponding number of linearly independent eigenvectors, which is called its\n",
    "geometric multiplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, eigenvalues are important in linear algebra because they provide insights\n",
    "into how a matrix transforms vectors. They can reveal fundamental properties of a matrix \n",
    "and are widely used in various fields, including physics, engineering,\n",

    "Q7. Can you explain the geometric interpretation of eigenvectors and eigenvalues?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    Certainly! Eigenvectors and eigenvalues are fundamental concepts in linear\n",
    "algebra and have important geometric interpretations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Eigenvectors**:\n",
    "An eigenvector of a square matrix A is a non-zero vector v that, when multiplied by A,\n",
    "only changes in magnitude, not in direction. Mathematically, if v is an eigenvector\n",
    "of A, it satisfies the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "A * v = λ * v\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, λ (lambda) is the corresponding **eigenvalue**, which is a scalar.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Geometric Interpretation of Eigenvectors**:\n",
    "The geometric interpretation of eigenvectors involves understanding how they relate to \n",
    "linear transformations. When you apply a matrix A to an eigenvector v, it scales the \n",
    "vector by a factor of λ, without changing its direction.\n",
    "Here are some key points of this interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scaling**: The eigenvalue λ represents the scaling factor by which the eigenvector v\n",
    "is stretched or compressed when multiplied by A. If λ is positive, the eigenvector stretches \n",
    "or compresses, but it maintains its direction. If λ is negative, the eigenvector is scaled \n",
    "and inverted (i.e., it points in the opposite direction).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Direction**: The eigenvector points in the direction along which the linear \n",
    "transformation A has the most significant effect. It is as if this vector resists \n",
    "change when subjected to the transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Linear Independence**: Eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are\n",
    "linearly independent. This means they point in different, non-collinear directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Eigenvalue Magnitude**: The magnitude (absolute value) of the eigenvalue λ reflects\n",
    "how much stretching or compressing occurs along the corresponding eigenvector.\n",
    "A larger |λ| implies a greater magnitude change, while |λ| = 1 means no scaling occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Eigenvalue Sign**: The sign of the eigenvalue indicates whether the eigenvector \n",
    "is stretched or compressed (positive λ) or inverted (negative λ) under the transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, eigenvectors represent directions that are preserved (or scaled) by a linear\n",
    "transformation, while eigenvalues indicate the magnitude of that scaling or compression\n",
    "along those directions. Understanding eigenvectors and eigenvalues is crucial in various \n",
    "fields, including physics, engineering, computer graphics, and data analysis,\n",

    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "No, a matrix cannot have more than one set of eigenvalues, but it can have \n",
    "multiple sets of linearly independent eigenvectors corresponding to the same eigenvalues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigenvalues are characteristic values associated with a matrix and are unique to that matrix. \n",
