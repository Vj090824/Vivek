    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "       A database is a structured collection of data that is organized, managed, and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval,\n",
    "        updating, and manipulation of information. Databases are widely used in various applications and systems to store and manage large \n",
    "        amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL and NoSQL are two different types of database management systems that differ in their data models, querying languages, and design principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) Databases:\n",
    "SQL databases are based on the relational data model, which organizes data into tables with rows and columns. These databases use SQL as the\n",
    "standard language for defining and manipulating the data. Some popular SQL database systems include MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft \n",
    "SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of SQL databases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Structure: SQL databases have a predefined schema that defines the structure of the data, including tables, columns, data types, and \n",
    "relationships between tables.\n",
    "ACID Transactions: SQL databases emphasize ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, ensuring that transactions are\n",
    "reliably processed and maintain data integrity.\n",
    "Scalability: SQL databases can handle structured and complex queries efficiently, making them suitable for applications with complex data\n",
    "relationships and join operations.\n",
    "Data Integrity: SQL databases enforce referential integrity constraints, allowing for the establishment of relationships between tables and\n",
    "ensuring data consistency.\n",
    "NoSQL (Not Only SQL) Databases:\n",
    "NoSQL databases are designed to handle large-scale, unstructured, and rapidly changing data. They depart from the traditional relational model\n",
    "and offer flexible schemas, horizontal scalability, and high performance. NoSQL databases employ various data models, such as key-value pairs,\n",
    "document-oriented, columnar, and graph-based models. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, and Neo4j.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of NoSQL databases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible Schema: NoSQL databases allow for schema-less or dynamic schemas, allowing the addition or modification of fields without altering \n",
    "the entire database structure.\n",
    "Horizontal Scalability: NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally across multiple servers, enabling handling of large amounts of data \n",
    "and high traffic loads.\n",
    "High Performance: NoSQL databases optimize for read/write performance and can provide faster response times by avoiding complex joins and other\n",
    "operations typically found in SQL databases.\n",
    "Data Variety: NoSQL databases are capable of handling diverse data types and structures, making them suitable for applications with varying data\n",
    "formats, such as social media, IoT, and real-time analytics.\n",
    "It's important to note that SQL and NoSQL databases have different strengths and use cases. The choice between them depends on the\n",
    "specific requirements of an application, including data structure, scalability needs, performance goals, and development flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  \n",
    "     DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It is a set of SQL (Structured Query Language) commands used to define and manage the\n",
    "        structure of a database. DDL statements are responsible for creating, altering, and deleting database objects such as tables, \n",
    "        indexes, views, and schemas.\n",
    "\n",
    "An explanation of the four common DDL commands you mentioned along with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE: The CREATE command is used to create new database objects such as tables, views, indexes, or schemas. It specifies the name of the object,\n",
    "its structure, and other properties. For example, to create a table called \"employees\" with columns for \"id,\" \"name,\" and \"salary,\" the following SQL\n",
    "statement can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "    id INT,\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    salary DECIMAL(10,2)\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP: The DROP command is used to remove an existing database object from the database. It permanently deletes the object and all its associated data.\n",
    "For example, to drop the \"employees\" table created in the previous example, the following SQL statement can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "ALTER: The ALTER command is used to modify the structure or properties of an existing database object. It allows you to add, modify, or drop columns,\n",
    "change data types, or rename objects. For example, to add a new column called \"department\" to the \"employees\" table, the following SQL statement can be \n",
    "used:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees\n",
    "ADD COLUMN department VARCHAR(50);\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE command is used to remove all the data from a table, but it keeps the structure intact. It is faster than using DELETE to \n",
    "remove all rows because it does not generate individual row-level delete operations. For example, to remove all data from the \"employees\" table, \n",
    "the following SQL statement can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE employees;\n",
    "These are just a few examples of how the CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE commands are used in DDL.\n",
    "They provide the necessary flexibility to define and manage the structure of a database to meet the requirements of an application or system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.no.3:  What is DML? Explain INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "      DML stands for Data Manipulation Language, which is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to manipulate data within a database.\n",
    "        DML consists of three primary operations: INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT:\n",
    "The INSERT statement is used to add new records to a table in a database. It allows you to specify the values to be inserted into specific columns \n",
    "of the table. Here's an example:\n",
    "Suppose we have a table called \"Employees\" with columns: \"ID\" (integer), \"Name\" (text), and \"Salary\" (decimal).\n",
    "\n",
    "To insert a new employee record, you would use the INSERT statement like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT INTO Employees (ID, Name, Salary)\n",
    "VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 5000);\n",
    "This statement adds a new employee with ID 1, name 'John Doe', and a salary of 5000 to the \"Employees\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE:\n",
    "The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing records in a table. It allows you to change the values of one or more columns for specific rows.\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "Continuing with the \"Employees\" table, let's say we want to update the salary of employee ID 1 to 6000. You would use the UPDATE statement like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE Employees\n",
    "SET Salary = 6000\n",
    "WHERE ID = 1;\n",
    "This statement updates the \"Salary\" column of the \"Employees\" table to 6000 for the employee with ID 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "DELETE:\n",
    "The DELETE statement is used to remove one or more records from a table. It allows you to specify a condition to identify the rows to be deleted. \n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "Suppose we want to delete the employee with ID 1 from the \"Employees\" table. You would use the DELETE statement like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "DELETE FROM Employees\n",
    "WHERE ID = 1;\n",
    "This statement deletes the row(s) from the \"Employees\" table where the ID column is equal to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the basic operations of DML in SQL. They provide the ability to insert new data, update existing data,\n",
    "and delete unwanted data in a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What is DQL? Explain SELECT with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: DQL stands for Data Query Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) that is used for retrieving data from a \n",
    "relational database management system (RDBMS). DQL is primarily focused on querying data and does not involve modifying the structure or\n",
    "contents of the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most commonly used statement in DQL is the SELECT statement, which is used to retrieve data from one or more database tables based on \n",
    "specific criteria. The SELECT statement allows you to specify the columns you want to retrieve, the table(s) you want to query, and any\n",
    "conditions that must be met for the data to be included in the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a SELECT statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT column1, column2, ...\n",
    "FROM table\n",
    "WHERE condition;\n",
    "Let's say we have a table called \"Customers\" with the following columns: \"CustomerID\", \"FirstName\", \"LastName\", \"Email\", and \"City\".\n",
    "We want to retrieve the customer IDs, first names, and cities of customers who live in New York. The SELECT statement for this query would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT CustomerID, FirstName, City\n",
    "FROM Customers\n",
    "WHERE City = 'New York';\n",
    "The result of this query would be a result set containing the CustomerID, FirstName, and City columns for all customers who \n",
    "live in New York. The result set might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "CustomerID | FirstName | City\n",
    "-----------------------------\n",
    "1          | John      | New York\n",
    "3          | Emily     | New York\n",
    "7          | David     | New York\n",
    "In this example, the SELECT statement specifies the columns to retrieve (CustomerID, FirstName, and City) and the table to query (Customers).\n",
    "The WHERE clause filters the result set based on the condition \"City = 'New York'\", selecting only the rows where the City column has the value \n",
    "'New York'.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  \n",
    "      A primary key and a foreign key are two important concepts that define relationships between tables. Let's explore each of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary Key:\n",
    "A primary key is a unique identifier for each record or row in a database table. It uniquely identifies a particular row and ensures \n",
    "that no two rows have the same value for the primary key column. Here are some key characteristics of a primary key:\n",
    "Uniqueness: Each value in the primary key column must be unique within the table.\n",
    "Non-nullability: A primary key column cannot have null (empty) values. It ensures that each record has a valid identifier.\n",
    "Stability: The value of a primary key should remain constant and not change over time.\n",
    "Single value: Each row has a single primary key value, which distinguishes it from other rows in the table.\n",
    "Indexing: Primary keys are typically indexed, which facilitates fast retrieval and efficient querying of data.\n",
    "Common examples of primary keys include social security numbers, email addresses, user IDs, or auto-incrementing numbers \n",
    "assigned by the database system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign Key:\n",
    "A foreign key is a field or a set of fields in a table that refers to the primary key of another table.\n",
    "It establishes a relationship between two tables based on the values of the foreign key and the primary key.\n",
    "Here are some key characteristics of a foreign key:\n",
    "Referential integrity: A foreign key enforces referential integrity, meaning that it ensures that the values in the foreign key column\n",
    "correspond to existing values in the referenced primary key column.\n",
    "Relationship establishment: It establishes relationships between tables, defining how data in one table is related to data in another table.\n",
    "Multiple occurrences: Multiple rows in a table can have the same foreign key value, indicating a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship with\n",
    "the referenced table.\n",
    "Nullability: Unlike a primary key, a foreign key column can contain null values. A null foreign key value indicates that there is no corresponding\n",
    "record in the referenced table.\n",
    "Foreign keys are commonly used in relational databases to establish relationships between related tables and enforce data integrity and consistency. \n",
    "They ensure that data is properly linked and allow for efficient retrieval and querying of related information.\n",
    "\n",
    "It  worth noting that primary keys and foreign keys can be composed of multiple columns (composite keys) when a single column is not sufficient to \n",
    "uniquely identify records or establish relationships between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Write a python code to connect MySQL to python. Explain the cursor() and execute() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans :  \n",
    "    \n",
    "        An example of Python code that connects to MySQL and explains the cursor() and execute() methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "import mysql.connector\n",
    "\n",
    "# Establishing a connection to MySQL\n",
    "cnx = mysql.connector.connect(\n",
    "    host=\"localhost\",  # Replace with your MySQL server hostname\n",
    "    user=\"your_username\",  # Replace with your MySQL username\n",
    "    password=\"your_password\",  # Replace with your MySQL password\n",
    "    database=\"your_database\"  # Replace with the desired database name\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a cursor object\n",
    "cursor = cnx.cursor()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Executing SQL queries using the execute() method\n",
    "cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM your_table\")  # Replace with your desired SQL query\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fetching the results using the fetchall() method\n",
    "results = cursor.fetchall()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Performing operations on the fetched results\n",
    "for row in results:\n",
    "    # Process each row of data\n",
    "    print(row)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Closing the cursor and the connection\n",
    "cursor.close()\n",
    "cnx.close()\n",
    "Explanation of the cursor() method:\n",
    "\n",
    "The cursor() method is used to create a cursor object, which enables you to interact with the MySQL database.\n",
    "It is called on the MySQL connection object (cnx in this case) to create a new cursor.\n",
    "The cursor object allows you to execute SQL queries, fetch results, and perform other database operations.\n",
    "Explanation of the execute() method:\n",
    "\n",
    "The execute() method is used to execute SQL queries or statements on the MySQL server.\n",
    "It is called on the cursor object and takes an SQL query as a parameter.\n",
    "The query is sent to the MySQL server for execution.\n",
    "The execute() method can handle parameterized queries by passing parameters as a tuple or dictionary.\n",
    "It can execute any type of SQL statement, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.\n",
    "In the provided code, we establish a connection to the MySQL server using the mysql.connector.connect() method. \n",
    "Then, we create a cursor object using the cursor() method. Subsequently, we execute an SQL query using the execute() method,\n",
    "which retrieves data from the specified table. The fetched results are stored in the results variable. \n",
    "Finally, we iterate over the results and process each row of data. After that, we close the cursor and the connection using the close() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to replace the placeholders (hostname, username, password, database name, table name, etc.)\n",
    "with the appropriate values for your MySQL setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Give the order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  \n",
    "      The order of execution of SQL clauses in a query typically follows the logical order as described below:\n",
    "\n",
    "FROM: The FROM clause specifies the table(s) from which the data will be retrieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "WHERE: The WHERE clause filters the rows based on specified conditions. It is used to narrow down the result set by applying predicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "GROUP BY: The GROUP BY clause is used to group rows based on one or more columns. It is often used in combination with aggregate functions like \n",
    "COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "HAVING: The HAVING clause filters the grouped rows based on specified conditions. It is similar to the WHERE clause but operates on grouped data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT: The SELECT clause is used to specify the columns to be included in the result set. It comes after the previous clauses to ensure \n",
    "that the columns are available for selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "ORDER BY: The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set based on one or more columns. It is applied after the SELECT clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "LIMIT/OFFSET: The LIMIT clause is used to restrict the number of rows returned by the query, while the OFFSET clause specifies the starting point \n",
    "for the result set. \n",
    "These clauses are typically used for pagination or limiting the number of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that not all clauses are required in every SQL query, and their order may vary depending on the specific requirements \n",
    "of the query. However, the sequence mentioned above represents the common order of execution for a typical SQL query."
