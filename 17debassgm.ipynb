    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "       MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database system. It is designed to store and manage unstructured or semi-structured data as\n",
    "        JSON-like documents, providing high scalability, flexibility, and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are a class of database systems that do not use the traditional tabular relational model \n",
    "of storing data. Instead, they offer various data models like key-value, document, columnar, or graph, allowing for more flexible data storage\n",
    "and retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to SQL databases, which are based on a fixed schema and use structured query language (SQL) for data manipulation, non-relational\n",
    "databases like MongoDB offer the following advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema flexibility: Non-relational databases can handle unstructured or semi-structured data, allowing for dynamic and evolving schemas. \n",
    "This flexibility is beneficial when dealing with rapidly changing or undefined data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Horizontal scalability: NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally, meaning they can distribute data across multiple servers,\n",
    "enabling efficient handling of large datasets and high traffic loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance: Non-relational databases are optimized for read/write performance, especially when dealing with large volumes of data.\n",
    "They can handle high-speed data ingestion and retrieval, making them suitable for real-time applications and big data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agile development: NoSQL databases facilitate agile development practices by allowing developers to quickly iterate and adapt their\n",
    "data models as the application evolves. There is no need to modify predefined schemas, making it easier to accommodate changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Rapidly changing data requirements: When dealing with evolving or undefined data structures, MongoDB's flexible schema allows developers to adapt the\n",
    "data model without the need for costly and time-consuming schema migrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large-scale applications: MongoDB's horizontal scalability and efficient sharding capabilities make it well-suited for handling large datasets\n",
    "and high traffic loads. It can scale out across multiple servers seamlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-time analytics: MongoDB's ability to handle high-speed data ingestion and real-time data processing makes it suitable for applications that\n",
    "require real-time analytics, such as monitoring systems, IoT applications, or social media platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agile development environments: MongoDB's schema flexibility enables developers to work in agile development environments where requirements may \n",
    "change frequently. It allows for rapid prototyping and iteration without the need for strict schema definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the choice between MongoDB and SQL databases depends on specific use cases, data requirements, and the overall system \n",
    "architecture. Each database type has its strengths and weaknesses, and it's crucial to evaluate them in the context of your project before making \n",
    "a decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "      MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that offers a range of features and capabilities. Here are some of the key features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "Document-oriented: MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents called BSON (Binary JSON) that can vary in structure and can be nested.\n",
    "This schema-less design allows for easy data modeling and accommodates evolving data requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: MongoDB is horizontally scalable, meaning it can handle large amounts of data and high traffic loads by distributing data across\n",
    "multiple servers. It supports automatic sharding, which partitions data across multiple machines, enabling horizontal scaling without sacrificing\n",
    "performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "High availability: MongoDB provides built-in replication and automatic failover. Replication allows you to create multiple copies of data across \n",
    "different servers, ensuring data redundancy and availability. If a primary server fails, MongoDB automatically promotes a secondary server to take \n",
    "over, minimizing downtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible data model: MongoDB's document structure allows for easy handling of complex data structures. It supports arrays, nested documents,\n",
    "and various data types, giving you the flexibility to model your data according to your application's needs. This flexibility also makes it\n",
    "easier to evolve your data schema over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing and querying: MongoDB supports indexes, which improve query performance by facilitating fast data retrieval. It provides various types of \n",
    "indexes, including single-field indexes, compound indexes, text indexes, and geospatial indexes, allowing you to optimize queries based on different\n",
    "criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ad hoc queries: MongoDB supports powerful ad hoc queries, allowing you to query your data using a flexible and expressive query language.\n",
    "The query language includes a wide range of operators and supports aggregation pipelines for advanced data processing and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Full-text search: MongoDB offers full-text search capabilities to perform text-based searches on data stored in the database. \n",
    "It supports stemming, text indexing, language-specific analyzers, and relevance-based ranking, enabling efficient searching and matching of text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Horizontal and vertical scaling: MongoDB can scale both horizontally and vertically. Horizontal scaling involves distributing data across multiple\n",
    "servers, while vertical scaling involves increasing the computing power and resources of a single server. MongoDB provides options for both approaches,\n",
    "allowing you to scale your database infrastructure as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rich ecosystem and community: MongoDB has a vibrant and active community, with extensive documentation, tutorials, and resources available. \n",
    "It also has a rich ecosystem with support for various programming languages, frameworks, and tools, making it easier to integrate MongoDB\n",
    "into your application stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "These features make MongoDB a popular choice for applications that require flexibility, scalability, and high-performance data storage and retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Write a code to connect MongoDB to Python. Also, create a database and a collection in MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "      An example code snippet that demonstrates how to connect to MongoDB, create a database, and create a collection within that database:\n",
    "\n",
    "import pymongo\n",
    "\n",
    "# Establish a connection to MongoDB\n",
    "client = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a new database\n",
    "mydb = client[\"mydatabase\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a new collection within the database\n",
    "mycollection = mydb[\"mycollection\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Test data\n",
    "data = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30, \"city\": \"New York\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert the data into the collection\n",
    "mycollection.insert_one(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the inserted document's ID\n",
    "print(\"Inserted document ID:\", data[\"_id\"])\n",
    "In this example, we first import the pymongo library. Then, we establish a connection to MongoDB using pymongo.MongoClient,\n",
    "specifying the connection URL (in this case, connecting to a local MongoDB instance running on the default port 27017).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we create a new database called \"mydatabase\" using client[\"mydatabase\"]. If the database already exists, this step is not required.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, we create a new collection called \"mycollection\" within the \"mydatabase\" using mydb[\"mycollection\"].\n",
    "If the collection already exists, this step is also not required.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define some test data as a Python dictionary and insert it into the collection using mycollection.insert_one(data).\n",
    "The insert_one() method inserts a single document into the collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we print the inserted document ID, which is automatically generated by MongoDB and stored in the \"_id\" field of the inserted document.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Using the database and the collection created in question number 3, write a code to insert one record,\n",
    "and insert many records. Use the find() and find_one() methods to print the inserted record.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "    \n",
    "       To insert records into the database and print the inserted records using the find() and find_one() methods, you can use the following code:\n",
    "\n",

    "# Connect to the MongoDB server\n",
    "client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access the database\n",
    "db = client['your_database_name']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access the collection\n",
    "collection = db['your_collection_name']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert one record\n",
    "record_one = {\n",
    "    'name': 'John Doe',\n",
    "    'age': 30,\n",
    "    'email': 'johndoe@example.com'\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert the record\n",
    "inserted_one = collection.insert_one(record_one)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the inserted record using find_one()\n",
    "print('Inserted Record:')\n",
    "print(collection.find_one({'_id': inserted_one.inserted_id}))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert many records\n",
    "records_many = [\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        'name': 'Jane Smith',\n",
    "        'age': 25,\n",
    "        'email': 'janesmith@example.com'\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        'name': 'Mike Johnson',\n",
    "        'age': 35,\n",
    "        'email': 'mikejohnson@example.com'\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        'name': 'Sarah Williams',\n",
    "        'age': 28,\n",
    "        'email': 'sarahwilliams@example.com'\n",
    "    }\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert the records\n",
    "inserted_many = collection.insert_many(records_many)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the inserted records using find()\n",
    "print('Inserted Records:')\n",
    "for record in collection.find({'_id': {'$in': inserted_many.inserted_ids}}):\n",
    "    print(record)\n",
    "Make sure to replace 'your_database_name' and 'your_collection_name' with the actual names of your database and collection. \n",
    "This code connects to the MongoDB server, accesses the specified database and collection, inserts one record using insert_one(),\n",
    "prints the inserted record using find_one(), inserts multiple records using insert_many(), and prints the inserted records using find().\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Explain how you can use the find() method to query the MongoDB database. Write a simple code to\n",
    "demonstrate this.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  \n",
    "     The find() method in MongoDB is used to query a database collection and retrieve documents that match specific criteria.\n",
    "        It allows you to specify conditions or filters to narrow down the results based on your requirements.\n",
    "        You can use various query operators and modifiers to construct complex queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "    An simple code example that demonstrates how to use the find() method in MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "from pymongo import MongoClient\n",
    "\n",
    "# Connect to the MongoDB server\n",
    "client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access the database\n",
    "db = client['your_database_name']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access the collection\n",
    "collection = db['your_collection_name']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Query documents using find()\n",
    "query = {'age': {'$gt': 25}}  # Find documents where 'age' field is greater than 25\n",
    "\n",
    "# Retrieve the matching documents\n",
    "results = collection.find(query)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the matching documents\n",
    "for doc in results:\n",
    "    print(doc)\n",
    "    \n",
    "In this code, we connect to the MongoDB server, access the specified database and collection, and define a query using the find() method.\n",
    "The query specifies a condition where the 'age' field should be greater than 25 using the $gt (greater than) operator.\n",
    "The find() method returns a cursor object that can be iterated over to retrieve the matching documents. We then iterate over the cursor \n",
    "and print each document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to replace 'your_database_name' and 'your_collection_name' with the actual names of your database and collection. \n",
    "Additionally, you can customize the query by modifying the query variable to suit your specific filtering requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Explain the sort() method. Give an example to demonstrate sorting in MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  \n",
    "      In MongoDB, the sort() method is used to sort the documents in a collection based on a specified field or fields. \n",
    "        It allows you to specify the sorting order, which can be ascending (1) or descending (-1). The sort() method is typically used \n",
    "        in combination with the find() method to retrieve documents in a specific order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax of the sort() method in MongoDB is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "db.collection.find().sort(field, order)\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "db.collection is the name of the collection you want to query.\n",
    "field is the field based on which you want to sort the documents.\n",
    "order is the sorting order. Use 1 for ascending order and -1 for descending order.\n",
    "Here's an example to demonstrate sorting in MongoDB using the Python driver:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "from pymongo import MongoClient\n",
    "\n",
    "# Connect to MongoDB\n",
    "client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')\n",
    "db = client['your_database_name']\n",
    "collection = db['your_collection_name']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert sample documents\n",
    "collection.insert_many([\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 25},\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30},\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 20}\n",
    "])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sort documents by age in ascending order\n",
    "asc_sorted_documents = collection.find().sort(\"age\", 1)\n",
    "for doc in asc_sorted_documents:\n",
    "    print(doc)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sort documents by age in descending order\n",
    "desc_sorted_documents = collection.find().sort(\"age\", -1)\n",
    "for doc in desc_sorted_documents:\n",
    "    print(doc)\n",
    "    \n",
    "In the example above, we first connect to the MongoDB server and specify the database and collection we want to work with.\n",
    "Then, we insert some sample documents into the collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we use the sort() method to retrieve the documents in ascending and descending order based on the \"age\" field. \n",
    "The sorted documents are returned as a cursor, which we iterate over and print each document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the sort() method can also accept multiple fields and sort documents based on multiple criteria.\n",
    "You can pass in a list of field-order pairs to specify the sorting order for each field.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Explain why delete_one(), delete_many(), and drop() is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  \n",
    "        In MongoDB, the delete_one(), delete_many(), and drop() methods are used to remove documents and collections from a database.\n",
    "        Each method serves a specific purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "delete_one():\n",
    "The delete_one() method is used to delete a single document that matches a specified filter. It takes a filter parameter to specify \n",
    "which document(s) to delete. If multiple documents match the filter, it will delete only the first one it encounters.Example usage:\n",
    " \n",
    " Example usage:\n",
    "        \n",
    "db.collection.delete_one({ \"name\": \"John\" })\n",
    "delete_many():\n",
    "    \n",
    "The delete_many() method is used to delete multiple documents that match a specified filter. \n",
    "It takes a filter parameter to specify which documents to delete. It removes all documents that match the filter criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "db.collection.delete_many({ \"age\": { \"$gte\": 30 } })\n",
    "drop():\n",
    "    \n",
    "The drop() method is used to remove an entire collection from a database. It permanently deletes the collection,\n",
    "including all its documents and indexes. This operation cannot be undone, so it should be used with caution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "db.collection.drop()\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods provide flexibility when managing data in MongoDB. \n",
    "delete_one() and delete_many() are useful for removing specific documents based on filter conditions,\n",
    "while drop() is used when you want to completely remove a collection."
