    "Q.no.1:  Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode\n",
    "of file opening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:   In Python, the open() function is used to open a file. It takes the filename \n",
    "as a parameter and returns a file object, \n",
    "which can be used to read, write, or manipulate the contents of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The open() function takes two arguments: the filename and the mode.\n",
    "The mode specifies the purpose for which the file is\n",
    "being opened. Here are the different modes of file opening:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"r\" (Read mode): This is the default mode when no mode is specified. It opens the file for reading.\n",
    "If the file does not exist,\n",
    "it raises a FileNotFoundError. When opened in read mode, you can only read the contents of the file; \n",
    "you cannot modify or write to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"w\" (Write mode): This mode opens the file for writing. If the file already exists, it truncates the file to zero length. \n",
    "If the file does not exist, it creates a new file. Any existing contents of the file are overwritten. \n",
    "If you write to a file that does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"a\" (Append mode): This mode opens the file for appending. If the file already exists,\n",
    "it moves the file pointer to the end of \n",
    "the file. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file. In append mode, \n",
    "any data written to the file is added at the end,\n",
    "preserving the existing contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"x\" (Exclusive creation mode): This mode is used to create a new file, \n",
    "but it raises a FileExistsError if the file already exists.\n",
    "It ensures that a new file is created only if the specified file does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"t\" (Text mode): This is the default mode when opening a file. \n",
    "It opens the file in text mode, allowing you to read and write text\n",
    "data. In text mode, the file contents are treated as strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"b\" (Binary mode): This mode is used to open the file in binary mode.\n",
    "It allows you to read and write binary data, such as images,\n",
    "audio files, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can combine the mode characters to specify multiple modes.\n",
    "For example, \"r+\" opens the file for both reading and writing,\n",
    "while \"wb\" opens the file in binary write mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here An example that demonstrates opening a file in different modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open a file in read mode\n",
    "file_read = open(\"example.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open a file in write mode\n",
    "file_write = open(\"example.txt\", \"w\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open a file in append mode\n",
    "file_append = open(\"example.txt\", \"a\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open a file in exclusive creation mode\n",
    "file_create = open(\"example.txt\", \"x\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open a file in binary mode\n",
    "file_binary = open(\"example.txt\", \"rb\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Close the files\n",
    "\n",
    "file_read.close()\n",
    "file_write.close()\n",
    "file_append.close()\n",
    "file_create.close()\n",
    "file_binary.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example,\n",
    "\n",
    "we open the same file \"example.txt\" in different modes using the open() function. \n",
    "Each file is opened with a specific mode, and we assign the returned file object to a variable. \n",
    "After performing operations on the file,\n",
    "its important to close the file using the close() method to release the system \n",
    "resources associated with the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.no.2:  Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The close() function is used to close a file that was opened using the open() function.\n",
    "    It releases the system resources associated with the file, \n",
    "    such as file buffers and operating system file descriptors.\n",
    "    Closing a file is an important practice in file handling for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource Management: When a file is opened, system resources are allocated to handle the file. \n",
    "These resources include memory buffers and operating system file descriptors. \n",
    "Closing the file with close() frees up these resources, allowing them to be used for other purposes. \n",
    "Failing to close a file can result in resource leaks and inefficient memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Integrity: When you write data to a file, it may be stored in memory\n",
    "buffers before being flushed to the physical storage.\n",
    "Calling close() ensures that any pending data in the buffers is written to the file before closing.\n",
    "If you don't close the file,\n",
    "there is a risk of losing unsaved data.\n",
    "\n",
    "File Locking: In some operating systems, when a file is opened, it may be locked to prevent other processes from modifying\n",
    "it simultaneously. Closing the file releases the lock, allowing other processes to access and modify the file if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "File Size Limitations: Some operating systems have limitations on the maximum number of files a process can have open \n",
    "simultaneously. If you don't close files when you're done with them, you may exceed this limit, causing issues in your \n",
    "program or system.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure proper file handling and prevent resource leaks, it is essential to close files after you have finished reading \n",
    "from or writing to them. Although Python automatically closes files when the program terminates,\n",
    "it's considered good practice\n",
    "to explicitly close files using close() as soon as you're done with them. Alternatively, \n",
    "you can also use the with statement\n",
    "in Python, which automatically takes care of closing the file for you:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "with open(\"example.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Perform operations on the file\n",
    "\n",
    "# The file is automatically closed when the 'with' block is exited\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the with statement, the file will be automatically closed at the end of the block,\n",
    "even if an exception occurs within\n",
    "the block. This helps ensure proper file handling and avoids the need for explicit close() calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Certainly! In Python, there are several methods available for reading text from a file.\n",
    "    An explanation of read(), readline(), and readlines() along with Python code examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "read():\n",
    "    The read() method reads the entire content of a file as a single string.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example using read()\n",

    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(content)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the read() method is used to read the content of the file named \n",
    "\"sample.txt\" and store it in the content variable. \n",
    "The entire file content is read as a single string and printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "readline():\n",
    "    The readline() method reads a single line from a file at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example using readline()\n",
    "file_name = \"sample.txt\"\n",

    "print(line2)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the readline() method is used to read the first line from the file and store it in the variable line1,\n",
    "and then it reads the second line and stores it in the variable line2. \n",
    "Each call to readline() reads one line from the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "readlines():\n",
    "    The readlines() method reads all the lines of a file and returns them as a list.\n",
    "\n",

    "Each line is represented as an element in the list. Then, we iterate over the lines list and print each line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in all these examples, the file is opened using the 'r' mode, which indicates reading mode. Make sure to replace\n",

    "open() together?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "    \n",
    "The with statement in Python is used in conjunction with the open() function to provide a convenient way to handle file\n",
    "        \n",
    "operations. It ensures that clean-up actions are performed automatically, \n",
    "even if exceptions occur during the execution of the code block.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with files, it is essential to properly handle their opening and \n",
    "closing to avoid resource leaks and potential data corruption. \n",
    "The open() function is used to open a file and returns a file object that provides methods for interacting\n",
    "with the file's contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of using the with statement with open() is that it takes care of closing the \n",
    "file automatically once the block of code under the with statement is executed or if an exception occurs.\n",
    "This eliminates the need to explicitly \n",
    "call the close() method on the file object.\n",
    "\n",
    " An example to illustrate the usage of with and open() together:\n",

    "    print(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Once the code block exits, the file is automatically closed\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the with statement ensures that the file is properly closed regardless of whether the code block is\n",
    "executed successfully or an exception occurs. This ensures that system resources are managed efficiently and the file is \n",
    "not left open, preventing potential issues such as data loss or conflicts with other processes trying to access the file.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Close the file\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "In this example, the file \"example.txt\" is opened in write mode. The write() function is then used to write the string \n",
    "\"Hello, World!\\n\" to the file. The \\n is added to create a new line after the text. Finally, the file is closed using the\n",
    "close() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The writelines() function, on the other hand, is used to write multiple strings to a file. It takes an iterable \n",
    "(such as a list or tuple) of strings as an argument and writes each string to the file consecutively. Like write(),\n",
    "it starts writing from the current position of the file pointer and overwrites any existing content unless in append mode.\n",
