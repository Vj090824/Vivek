    "Q1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects.\n",
    "    It defines a set of attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects of that class will have.\n",
    "    In simpler terms, a class can be thought of as a blueprint for creating objects with predefined characteristics and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class. It is a tangible entity that is created using theblueprint defined by the class.\n",
    "Each object created from a class has its own set of data and can perform actions defined by the methods of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    " an example to illustrate the concept of a class and object. Suppose we want to model a \"Car\" in an object-oriented manner.\n",
    "    We can define a class called \"Car\" that specifies the attributes and behaviors common to all cars.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n",
    "        self.make = make\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "        self.year = year\n",
    "        self.is_running = False\n",
    "\n",
    "    def start(self):\n",
    "        \n",
    "        self.is_running = True\n",
    "        print(\"The car is now running.\")\n",
    "\n",

    "        if self.is_running:\n",
    "            print(\"Beep! Beep!\")\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(\"The car is not running.\")\n",

    "\n",
    "Q2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation:  Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit called an object.\n",
    "It hides the internal details and provides an interface to interact with the object.\n",
    "Encapsulation helps in achieving data abstractionand data security.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class inherits the properties and behaviors of another class.\n",
    "It allows the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes, where the child class (derived class) \n",
    "inherits the members of the parent class (base class). This promotes code reuse and the concept of \"is-a\" relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class.\n",
    "It enables the use of a single interface to represent different forms or types. Polymorphism can be\n",
    "achieved through method overloading and method overriding, allowing different implementations of methods based on the type of object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction refers to the process of representing essential features without including the background details or complexities.\n",
    "It focuses on capturing the relevant information and behavior of an object, while hiding unnecessary implementation details.\n",
    "Abstraction helps in managing complexity and allows for the creation of abstract classes and interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Explain why the __init__() function is used. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The __init__() function is a special method in Python classes that is automatically called when an object of the class is created.\n",
    "It is used to initialize the attributes or properties of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose of the __init__() function is to set up the initial state of the object by assigning values to its attributes. \n",
    "These attributes define the characteristics or data associated with the object. By providing initial values through\n",
    "the __init__() function, we ensure that the object starts with the desired state.\n",
    "\n",
    "an example to illustrate the usage of the __init__() function:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n",
    "        self.make = make\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "        self.year = year\n",
    "        self.mileage = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "    def drive(self, miles):\n",
    "        self.mileage += miles\n",
    "\n",
    "my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Camry\", 2022)\n",
    "print(my_car.make)    # Output: Toyota\n",
    "print(my_car.model)   # Output: Camry\n",
    "print(my_car.year)    # Output: 2022\n",
    "print(my_car.mileage) # Output: 0\n",
    "\n",
    "my_car.drive(100)\n",
    "print(my_car.mileage) # Output: 100\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Why self is used in OOPs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    In object-oriented programming (OOP), the \"self\" keyword is used to refer to the current instance of a class. \n",
    "    It is a common convention in languages like Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of \"self\" allows objects to have their own unique identity and state within a class. When you create an object\n",
    "from a class, it becomes an instance of that class, and \"self\" is a reference to that specific instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of \"self\" is important because it enables you to access and modify the instance variables and methods of an object. \n",
    "It allows you to differentiate between instance variables and local variables or parameters within a class. By using \"self,\"\n",
    "you can access the attributes and methods specific to the instance, making the code more readable and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let consider a simple class called \"Car\" that has an instance variable called \"color.\" By using \"self.color,\"\n",
    "you can refer to the color attribute of a specific car object:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, color):\n",
    "        self.color = color\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_color(self):\n",
    "        return self.color\n",
    "\n",
    "my_car = Car(\"blue\")\n",
    "print(my_car.get_color())  # Output: blue\n",
    "In the above code, \"self.color\" refers to the \"color\" attribute of the \"my_car\" object, allowing us to set and retrieve its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, \"self\" is used in OOP to represent the current instance of a class and provides a way to access and manipulate instance\n",
    "variables and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What is inheritance? Give an example for each type of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    In object-oriented programming, inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. \n",
    "    The class that inherits is called the \"derived\" or \"child\" class, and the class from which it inherits is called the \"base\" or \"parent\" class.\n",
    "    Inheritance facilitates code reuse, as the derived class can access and extend the functionality of the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Single Inheritance: In single inheritance, a class inherits from a single base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "class Vehicle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, brand):\n",
    "        self.brand = brand\n",
    "\n",
    "    def display_brand(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Brand:\", self.brand)\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car(Vehicle):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, brand, model):\n",
    "        super().__init__(brand)\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "\n",
    "    def display_model(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Model:\", self.model)\n",
    "\n",
    "my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Camry\")\n",
    "my_car.display_brand()   # Output: Brand: Toyota\n",
    "my_car.display_model()   # Output: Model: Camry\n",
    "Multiple Inheritance: In multiple inheritance, a class inherits from multiple base classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def eat(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Eating...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Flyable:\n",
    "    def fly(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Flying...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Bird(Animal, Flyable):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "my_bird = Bird()\n",
    "my_bird.eat()   # Output: Eating...\n",
    "my_bird.fly()   # Output: Flying...\n",
    "Multilevel Inheritance: In multilevel inheritance, a class inherits from a derived class, creating a hierarchy of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def eat(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Eating...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Bird(Animal):\n",
    "    def fly(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Flying...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Parrot(Bird):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Speaking...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "my_parrot = Parrot()\n",
    "my_parrot.eat()    # Output: Eating...\n",
    "my_parrot.fly()    # Output: Flying...\n",
    "my_parrot.speak()  # Output: Speaking...\n",
    "Hierarchical Inheritance: In hierarchical inheritance, multiple derived classes inherit from a single base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def eat(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Eating...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def meow(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Meowing...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def bark(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Barking...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "my_cat = Cat()\n",
    "my_cat.eat()   # Output: Eating...\n",
    "my_cat.meow()  # Output: Meowing...\n",
    "\n",
    "my_dog = Dog()\n",
    "my_dog.eat()   # Output: Eating...\n",
    "my_dog.bark()  # Output: Barking...\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few examples of inheritance types. Inheritance allows classes to inherit and specialize behaviors, enabling code\n",
    "reuse and promoting a more modular and organized code structure."
