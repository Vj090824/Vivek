    "Q.no.1:\n",
    "Explain with an example each when to use a for loop and a while loop.\n",
    "answer: \n",
    "    For Loop:\n",
    "A for loop is generally used when you know the number of iterations \n",
    "or the range of values you want to iterate over in advance.The for loop \n",
    "allows us to perform the same operation (adding each number to the sum) \n",
    "on each element of the list without explicitly managing the loop counter or condition.\n",
    "It simplifies the process of iterating over a known collection or a specified range of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example that illustrates a situation where a for loop is a suitable choice.\n",
    "\n",
    " Example: Printing even numbers in a range\n",
    "\n",
    "for num in range(1, 11):\n",
    "    if num % 2 == 0:\n",
    "        print(num)\n",
    "The output of this code will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "2\n",
    "4\n",
    "6\n",
    "8\n",
    "10    \n",
    "  In this example, we use a for loop to iterate over a range of numbers from 1 to 10. \n",
    "    For each number in the range, we check if it is divisible by 2 (i.e., an even number) \n",
    "    using the modulus operator %. If the number is indeed even, we print it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The for loop allows us to iterate over each number in the specified range and perform the\n",
    "necessary check and print operation. In this case, since we know the range of numbers we want to work with, a for loop is a suitable choice.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    (2) While Loop:\n",
    "        A while loop in Python is a control flow structure that repeatedly executes a block of code\n",
    "        as long as a specified condition remains true. It allows you to create loops where the number\n",
    "        of iterations is not predetermined and depends on the condition specified.\n",
    "       \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example: Countdown Timer\n",
    "\n",
    "countdown = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "while countdown > 0:\n",
    "    print(countdown)\n",
    "    countdown -= 1\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Blast off!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we use a while loop to implement a countdown timer. The loop starts with the initial value\n",
    "of countdown equal to 10. Inside the loop, we print the current value of countdown and then decrement it by 1.\n",
    "The loop continues as long as the value of countdown is greater than 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "During each iteration of the while loop, the current value of countdown is printed. Once the value of\n",
    "countdown reaches 0, the loop condition becomes false, and the loop exits. After the loop, \n",
    "we print \"Blast off!\" to indicate the end of the countdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "The while loop is suitable for this scenario because the number of iterations (countdown from 10 to 0)\n",
    "is not known in advance. We keep executing the loop until the desired condition (countdown > 0) is no longer satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of this code will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "10\n",
    "9\n",
    "8\n",
    "7\n",
    "6\n",
    "5\n",
    "4\n",
    "3\n",
    "2\n",
    "1\n",
    "Blast off!\n",
    " It's important to ensure that the loop condition eventually becomes false to prevent an \n",
    "infinite loop. In this example, the countdown starts at 10 and decrements by 1\n",
    "during each iteration until it reaches 0, ensuring that the loop terminates.\n",
    "\n",
