    "    What is an iterator in python? Name the method used to initialise the iterator object and the method\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    In Python, an iterator is an object that allows iteration over a collection of elements,\n",

    "    What is a generator function in python? Why yield keyword is used? Give an example of a generator\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    In Python, a generator function is a special type of function that generates a sequence of values\n",
    "\n",

    "The \"yield\" keyword is used in generator functions to define the points at which the function should yield its current value.\n",
