    "In object-oriented programming, inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. \n",
    "The class that inherits is called the \"derived\" or \"child\" class, and the class from which it inherits is called the \"base\" or \"parent\" class. Inheritance facilitates code reuse, as the derived class can access and extend the functionality of the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Single Inheritance: In single inheritance, a class inherits from a single base class.\n",
