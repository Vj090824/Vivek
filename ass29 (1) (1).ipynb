    "Q.no.1:  who devloped python programming language?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "    Python programming language was developed by Guido van Rossum. Guido van Rossum started working on\n",
    "    Python in the late 1980s, \n",
    "    and the first version of Python was released in 1991. Guido van Rossum is often referred to as \n",
    "    the \"Benevolent Dictator for Life\" \n",
    "    (BDFL) of the Python community because of his significant contributions and leadership in \n",
    "    the language's development.\n",
    "    While Guido van Rossum stepped down as the Python BDFL in 2018,\n",
    "    his work and influence continue to shape the evolution of Python.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q.no.2:  which type of programming does python support?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    \n",
    "Python supports several programming paradigms, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedural Programming: Python allows you to write programs in a procedural style,\n",
    "where you break down your code into a sequence of\n",
    "steps or procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Python has built-in support for object-oriented programming.\n",
    "You can define classes and objects,\n",
    "encapsulate data and behavior within objects,\n",
    "and use inheritance and polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional Programming: Python supports functional programming concepts.\n",
    "It provides features like lambda functions, higher-order functions,\n",
    "and built-in functions like map(), filter(), and reduce().\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Imperative Programming: Python allows you to write code in an imperative style, \n",
    "where you specify the sequence of statements that modify\n",
    "the program's state.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Event-Driven Programming: Python provides libraries and frameworks for event-driven programming, \n",
    "where you write code that responds to events\n",
    "or messages asynchronously. For example, libraries like asyncio and frameworks like Twisted are commonly \n",
    "used for event-driven programming in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP): Although not built-in, Python supports AOP through\n",
    "third-party libraries like AspectLib and PyAOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its worth mentioning that Python is a versatile language and supports a wide range of programming styles, \n",
    "allowing developers to choose the\n",
    "paradigm that best suits their needs and the requirements of their projects.    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q.no.3:   Is python case senstive when dealing with identifiers?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Ans:  \n",
    "    Yes, Python is case-sensitive when dealing with identifiers. This means that uppercase and \n",
    "    lowercase letters are considered distinct\n",
    "    in variable names, function names, class names, and any other identifiers used in Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following code snippet demonstrates case sensitivity in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "variable = 10\n",
    "Variable = 20\n",
    "\n",
    "print(variable)  # Output: 10\n",
    "print(Variable)  # Output: 20\n",
    "In the above code, variable and Variable are treated as two separate identifiers. Assigning \n",
    "different values to each variable and printing\n",
    "them results in different output.\n",
    "\n",
    "It important to be consistent with the case when using identifiers in Python to avoid any confusion and unintended errors.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q.no.4: what is the correct extension of the  python file?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "  \n",
    " Ans: The correct extension for a Python file is \".py\". When you save a Python script, \n",
    "    you should give it a file name with the \".py\" extension\n",
    "    to indicate that it contains Python code.\n",
    "    For example, if you have a Python file named \"my_script.py\", the \".py\" extension signifies thatit is a Python file\n",
    "    and can be executed using a Python interpreter.   \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q.no.5: Is python code compiled or interpreted?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Ans : \n",
    "    Python is an interpreted programming language. When you run a Python program, \n",
    "    the source code is executed directly by the Python\n",
    "interpreter line by line, without the need for a separate compilation step. \n",
    "This means that you can write Python code and run it without explicitly compiling it into a machine-readable format.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's important to note that Python itself is implemented in a compiled language, such as C. \n",
    "The Python interpreter reads the Python source code and then compiles it into bytecode,\n",
    "which is a lower-level representation of the\n",
    "code that can be executed by the Python virtual machine (PVM). The bytecode is then interpreted and executed by the PVM.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, while Python code is not compiled to machine code like languages such as C or C++,\n",
    "it is compiled to an intermediate bytecode form,\n",
    "which is then interpreted by the Python interpreter. This interpretation process happens\n",
    "dynamically during the execution of the program.\n",

    "Q.no.6: Name a few blocks of code used to define in Python language.     \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Ans:  In Python, there are several blocks of code used for defining various elements of a program. \n",
    "Here are a few commonly used blocks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Function Definition Block: This block is used to define a function, which is a reusable piece of\n",
    "code that performs a specific task.\n",
    "It starts with the def keyword followed by the function name and a set of parentheses containing optional parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    print(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "Class Definition Block: This block is used to define a class, which is a blueprint for creating objects with certain\n",
    "attributes (variables) and behaviors (methods). It starts with the class keyword followed by the class name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "    def greet(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Hello, my name is\", self.name)\n",
    "        \n",
    "Conditional Blocks: These blocks are used to execute different sections of code based on specific conditions.\n",
    "The common conditional blocks are if, elif (short for \"else if\"), and else.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "if x > 0:\n",
    "    print(\"Positive number\")\n",
    "elif x < 0:\n",
    "    print(\"Negative number\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Zero\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "Loop Blocks: These blocks are used to repeat a section of code multiple times.\n",
    "The commonly used loop blocks are for and while.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# for loop\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "\n",
    "# while loop\n",
    "x = 0\n",
    "while x < 5:\n",
    "    print(x)\n",
    "    x += 1\n",
    "    \n",
    "These are just a few examples of the blocks used in Python. Python also supports other blocks \n",
    "like exception handling blocks (try, except, finally), \n",
    "context manager blocks (with), etc.\n",

    "Q.no.7: State a character used to give single-line comments in python.   \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    In Python, the character used to give single-line comments is the hash symbol (\"#\").\n",
    "    When the Python interpreter encounters a \"#\" in the code, it treats everything after it on the same line as a comment\n",
    "    and ignores it during execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a single-line comment in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# This is a single-line comment in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "    Comments are used to add explanatory notes, document code, or temporarily disable certain parts of the code\n",
    "without affecting the program functionality.\n",
    "They are helpful for improving code readability and aiding in code maintenance.    \n",

    "Ans:\n",
    "    There are several functions and methods that can help you determine \n",
    "    the version of Python you are currently working with.\n",
    "    Here are a few commonly used options:\n",
    "\n",
    "'sys.version': This function from the sys module returns a string containing the version number of the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "import sys\n",

    "\n",
    "import platform\n",
    "print(platform.python_version())\n",
    "\n",

    " Q.no.9: Python  supports the creation of anonymous function at run time, using a construct called ----------\n",
    "  \n",
    " Ans:\n",
    "        Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime using a construct called \"lambda.\"\n",
    "        The lambda keyword allows you to define small, inline functions without explicitly giving them a name.\n",
    "        Lambdas are useful when you need a simple function for a short period of time and don't want\n",
    "        to define a separate function using the \"def\" keyword.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        The general syntax of a lambda function:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "lambda arguments: expression\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, \n",
    "let's say you want to create a lambda function that takes two arguments and returns their sum:\n",

    "add = lambda x, y: x + y\n",
    "print(add(3, 5)) \n",
    "\n",
    "# Output: 8\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, lambda x, y: x + y creates an anonymous function that adds two numbers together.\n",
    "The lambda function can be assigned to a variable (add in this case) and invoked just like a regular named function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that lambda functions are limited in their functionality compared to regular functions. \n",
    "They are best suited for simple,\n",

    "    \n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    In Python, the maximum possible length of an identifier is not explicitly defined. However, Python\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    In Python, memory management is handled automatically through a mechanism called \"garbage collection.\" \n",
    "    The garbage collector is responsible for reclaiming memory that is no longer in use by the program, \n",
    "    freeing it up for future allocations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses a reference counting scheme as its primary memory management technique. \n",
    "Each object in Python has a reference count,\n",
    "which is the number of references to that object.\n",
    "When an object's reference count drops to zero, it means that no more references \n",
    "to that object exist, and the memory occupied by the object can be safely released.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, Python garbage collector employs a cycle \n",
    "detection mechanism to deal with situations where objects reference\n",
    "\n",
    "each other in a circular manner, creating reference cycles.\n",
    "These cycles could prevent objects from being garbage collected even\n",
    "when they are no longer reachable from the main program.\n",
    "The garbage collector periodically identifies and collects these cycles to free up memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's garbage collector runs in the background and is designed to be transparent to the developer. \n",
    "It automatically determines\n",
    "when to perform garbage collection based on various factors such as memory allocation patterns and thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of memory allocation, Python uses a heap data structure to manage the dynamic \n",
    "allocation and deallocation of objects. \n",
    "The heap is a large pool of memory from which objects are allocated as needed. \n",
    "When an object is created, memory is allocated from the heap to store its data. When an object is no longer needed,\n",
    "the memory is returned to the heap for reuse in future allocations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also provides low-level interfaces like the ctypes module, \n",
    "which allows direct memory management and interaction with C libraries.\n",
    "However, such manual memory management is typically unnecessary for most Python programs, \n",
    "as the automatic garbage collector handles memory management efficiently in the majority of cases.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    Yes, indentation is required in Python. In Python, indentation is used to define the \n",
    "    structure and hierarchy of code blocks. \n",
    "    It is not just for aesthetics but is a fundamental part of the language syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses indentation to indicate the scope of control structures such as loops,\n",
    "conditionals, and function definitions.\n",
    "The standard convention in Python is to use four spaces for each level of indentation.\n",
    "For example, consider the following code snippet:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "if x > 0:\n",
    "    print(\"x is positive\")\n",
    "    if x > 10:\n",
    "        print(\"x is greater than 10\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"x is non-positive\")\n",
    "In this example, the indentation level determines which lines of code belong to \n",
    "the inner if statement and the else statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you fail to properly indent your code, you will encounter an \"IndentationError\" at runtime, indicating that\n",
    "the indentation is incorrect. So, it's important to ensure consistent and correct indentation \n",
    "in Python to maintain code readability and functionality.\n",
