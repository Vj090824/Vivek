    "Q.no.1: What is Abstraction in OOps? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "    In object-oriented programming (OOP), abstraction is a concept that allows you to focus on essential details\n",
    "    and hide unnecessary complexities of a system or an object. It involves representing complex\n",
    "    real-world entities as simplified models in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is achieved through the use of classes and objects,\n",
    "where a class defines the common properties and behaviors\n",
    "of a group of objects, and an object is an instance of a class.\n",
    "By using abstraction, you can define the necessary attributes\n",
    "and methods of an object while hiding the internal implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    " example in Python to illustrate abstraction:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class Animal(ABC):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):\n",
    "        return \"Woof!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):\n",
    "        return \"Meow!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating objects of the derived classes\n",
    "dog = Dog(\"Buddy\")\n",
    "cat = Cat(\"Whiskers\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling the common method on the objects\n",
    "print(dog.make_sound())\n",
    "\n",
    " Output: Woof!\n",
    "\n",
    "print(cat.make_sound())\n",
    "\n",
    " Output: Meow!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have an abstract class Animal that defines the common behavior for all animals. \n",
    "The make_sound method is declared as an abstract method using the abstractmethod decorator from the abc module.\n",
    "This means that any class inheriting from Animal must provide its own implementation of make_sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Dog and Cat classes inherit from the Animal class and provide their own implementation of the make_sound method.\n",
    "By doing so, they satisfy the abstraction defined by the Animal class.\n",
    "\n",
    "By utilizing abstraction, we can create a generalized Animal class that can be inherited by specific animal classes.\n",
    "This allows us to treat different types of animals uniformly, \n",
    "without worrying about the specific implementation details of each animal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Q.no2:  Differentiate between Abstraction and Encapsulation. Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "    Abstraction and encapsulation are two fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP)\n",
    "    that serve different purposes. \n",
    "    Let's explore their differences and provide examples for better understanding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction focuses on creating a simplified representation of real-world\n",
    "entities or systems by hiding unnecessary details.\n",
    "It allows you to define the essential attributes and behaviors of an object or a group of objects while ignoring \n",
    "the implementation specifics.\n",
    "Abstraction is achieved through the use of abstract classes, interfaces, and abstract methods.\n",
    "It helps in creating a high-level view of the system, making it easier to understand and work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class Shape(ABC):\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Rectangle(Shape):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, length, width):\n",
    "        self.length = length\n",
    "        self.width = width\n",
    "\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return self.length * self.width\n",
    "\n",
    "class Circle(Shape):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, radius):\n",
    "        self.radius = radius\n",
    "\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating objects of the derived classes\n",
    "rectangle = Rectangle(5, 3)\n",
    "circle = Circle(4)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling the common method on the objects\n",
    "print(rectangle.area())\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: 15\n",
    "print(circle.area()) \n",
    "\n",
    "Output: 50.24\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the Shape class is an abstract class that defines a common behavior area for all shapes. \n",
    "It declares the area method as an abstract method using the abstractmethod decorator. Any class inheriting from Shape must\n",
    "provide its own implementation of the area method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Rectangle and Circle classes inherit from the Shape class and implement their own versions of the area method.\n",
    "They provide the necessary details to calculate the area of a rectangle and a circle, respectively. By using abstraction,\n",
    "we can treat different shapes uniformly without worrying about the specific implementation details of each shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is about bundling data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit, known as a class.\n",
    "It hides the internal details of an object and provides access to the data through methods, ensuring that the object's \n",
    "state is controlled and modified in a controlled manner.\n",
    "Encapsulation helps in achieving data abstraction and information hiding, preventing direct access to the internal\n",
    "representation of an object.\n",
    " \n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class BankAccount:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, account_number, balance):\n",
    "        self.account_number = account_number\n",
    "        self.balance = balance\n",
    "\n",
    "    def deposit(self, amount):\n",
    "        self.balance += amount\n",
    "\n",
    "    def withdraw(self, amount):\n",
    "        if self.balance >= amount:\n",
    "            self.balance -= amount\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(\"Insufficient funds\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_balance(self):\n",
    "        return self.balance\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an object of the BankAccount class\n",
    "account = BankAccount(\"123456\", 1000)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing the object's methods to modify and retrieve data\n",
    "account.deposit(500)\n",
    "account.withdraw(200)\n",
    "print(account.get_balance())\n",
    "\n",
    " Output: 1300\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the BankAccount class encapsulates the account number and balance data, along with\n",
    "the methods deposit, withdraw, and get_balance.\n",
    "The data is hidden from direct access and can only be modified or retrieved through the defined methods.\n",
    "Encapsulation provides control over the data and prevents unauthorized modification,\n",
    "ensuring the integrity of the object's state.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, abstraction is about creating simplified models by hiding unnecessary details, while encapsulation focuses \n",
    "on bundling data and methods into a single unit and controlling access to that data.\n",
    "Both concepts contribute to the overall \n",
    "principles of OOP and help in designing modular and maintainable code. \n",

    "Q.no.3:   What is abc module in python? Why is it used?   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "    In Python, the abc module stands for \"Abstract Base Classes.\" \n",
    "    It provides a mechanism for defining abstract base classes in Python.\n",
    "    Abstract base classes are classes that are meant to be subclassed, but they cannot be instantiated themselves.\n",
    "    They serve as a blueprint \n",
    "    for other classes to inherit from.\n",
    "\n",
    "The abc module is used when you want to define a common interface or behavior that multiple subclasses should adhere to.\n",
    "It allows you to define abstract methods and properties that must be implemented by the concrete subclasses.\n",
    "By enforcing a certain interface through abstract base classes,\n",
    "you can ensure that subclasses provide the necessary functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purposes of using the abc module are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining interfaces: Abstract base classes allow you to define a\n",
    "common interface that multiple subclasses should implement.\n",
    "This helps in writing more maintainable and modular code, as you can rely on\n",
    "the defined methods and properties across different implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enforcing implementation: Abstract base classes can define abstract methods\n",
    "and properties that must be implemented by the subclasses. \n",
    "If a subclass fails to implement these required methods and properties, it will raise an error at runtime, \n",
    "indicating that the subclass is incomplete or non-compliant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type checking and documentation: Abstract base classes can also be used for type checking and documentation purposes. \n",
    "By using abstract base classes as type hints, you can specify that a function or\n",
    "method expects an object of a specific abstract base class. \n",
    "This helps in documenting the expected behavior of the object and can provide better static type checking. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple example that demonstrates the usage of the abc module:\n",

    "    \n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class Shape(ABC):\n",

    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",

    "    def __init__(self, width, height):\n",
    "        self.width = width\n",
    "        self.height = height\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return self.width * self.height\n",

    "    \n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius\n",

    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "      Data abstraction is a key concept in computer science and software engineering that\n",
    "        allows us to simplify complex systems by hiding\n",
    "        unnecessary details and exposing only relevant information. \n",
    "        It involves creating abstract data types (ADTs) and defining\n",
    "        their behavior through interfaces. Here are some ways to achieve data abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and the methods that\n",
    "operate on that data into a single unit called a class. \n",
    "It provides a way to hide the internal implementation details of a class and\n",
    "expose only the necessary methods and properties.\n",
    "By encapsulating data, you can achieve data abstraction and prevent direct\n",
    "access to the underlying data, enforcing the use\n",
    "of predefined methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Class and Object Abstraction: By defining classes and objects, you can create abstract \n",
    "representations of real-world entities or concepts.\n",
    "Classes define the structure and behavior of objects, and objects represent specific instances of those classes.\n",
    "Through class and object abstraction, you can focus on the essential \n",
    "attributes and behaviors of an entity while abstracting away\n",
    "the irrelevant\n",
    "details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract Classes: Abstract classes are classes that cannot be instantiated and are designed to be subclassed. \n",
    "They provide a way to define\n",
    "common\n",
    "attributes and behaviors that can be inherited by subclasses. Abstract classes can contain abstract methods,\n",
    "which are method declarations\n",
    "without\n",
    "an implementation. By using abstract classes, you can define a common interface that subclasses must implement,\n",
    "enforcing a level of abstraction and consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interfaces: Interfaces define a contract for the behavior of a class without providing any implementation details.\n",
    "They specify a set of methods that a class must implement,\n",
    "allowing different classes to share a common interface while providing their own implementation.\n",
    "By programming to interfaces rather than concrete implementations, you can achieve a \n",
    "higher level of abstraction and decouple components in your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularization: Breaking down a complex system into smaller, manageable modules promotes data abstraction. \n",
    "Each module can have its own data\n",
    "structures and operations, and the internal implementation details are hidden from other modules.\n",
    "Modules communicate through well-defined \n",
    "interfaces, allowing them to interact while abstracting away the complexities of each module's internal workings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Access Layers: Data access layers provide an abstraction for accessing and manipulating data from various sources,\n",
    "such as databases\n",
    "or external APIs. By separating the data access logic from the rest of the application, you can achieve data abstraction.\n",
    "The application \n",
    "interacts with the data access layer through a well-defined interface, without needing to know the specific details\n",
    "of how the data is stored or retrieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, achieving data abstraction involves designing software components that hide unnecessary details, \n",
    "expose relevant information through well-defined interfaces,\n",
    "and provide a level of abstraction that simplifies the understanding and\n",
    "interaction with the underlying data structures and operations.\n",

    "Q.no.5:   Can we create an instance of an abstract class? Explain your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  \n",
    "    No, we cannot create an instance of an abstract class directly. An abstract class is a class that is meant\n",
    "    to be subclassed,and it typically contains one or more abstract methods that are \n",

    "    Abstract classes are designed to provide a common interface or behavior that\n",
    "    can be shared by multiple related classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of an abstract class is to be extended and implemented by concrete subclasses.\n",
    "These concrete subclasses provide the implementation for the abstract methods declared in the abstract class.\n",
    "When we create an object, we usually want to instantiate a specific concrete class, not an abstract class. \n",
    "Therefore, attempting to create an instance of an abstract class directly would not make sense because it doesn't\n",

    "\n",
    "However, it's important to note that we can create instances of concrete subclasses that inherit from the abstract class.\n",
    "These subclasses provide the necessary implementation for the abstract methods,\n",
    "and we can instantiate them to create objects.\n",
    "This allows us to take advantage of the common interface or behavior defined in \n",
    "the abstract class while also providing specific\n",
